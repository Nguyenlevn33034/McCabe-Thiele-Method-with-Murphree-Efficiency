# McCabe-Thiele-Method-with-Murphree-Efficiency
The McCabe–Thiele method is a technique commonly used in the fields of chemical and petroleum engineering to model the separation of two substances using a distillation column. The McCabe-Thiele method is a graphical method used to analyze distillation processes. It was named after its two inventors, Warren L. McCabe and Ernest Thiele.
The basic assumption of McCabe–Thiele is that the molar heats of vaporization and condensation of the components are equal, and that it reduces the vapor-liquid rate equally in all stages in the sections above the feed stage ( the feed stage) and the vapor and liquid flow rates are equal in all the feed stages.)
The McCabe-Thiele diagram is used to determine the number of theoretical stages required for the desired separation, by drawing a line from the material composition to the intersection with the equilibrium line. The slope of this line gives the reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of liquid returned to the column to the amount of product withdrawn. The intersection of this line with the equilibrium line gives the composition of the vapor leaving the top of the column.
